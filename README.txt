To Blueprint Users:
	- I've included the Binaries folder, so that you will have access to all the C++ classes, and you don't have to compile them.

To C++ Users:
	- In order to generate the Visual Studio Files; once the project is opened, navigate (from the top-menu) to File -> Generate Visual Studio Project
	- If you have another IDE, you will be able to generate the project files in a similar way.
